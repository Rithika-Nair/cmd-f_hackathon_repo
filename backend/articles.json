Over the past decade, Northwest Pacific countries have been implementing the NOWPAP Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter (RAP MALI) which aims to prevent, control and remove marine litter, including through annual marine litter management workshops and International Coastal Clean-up campaigns. NOWPAP hosts the Northwest Pacific Regional Node of the Global Partnership on Marine Litter (GPML), a major information portal on marine litter data in the region.",

Analysis of beached fulmars has been used to monitor plastic pollution in the North Sea since the 1980s. The latest findings, when compared to previous similar studies, indicate a substantial increase in plastic pollution over the past four decades.\n\nThe research group performed necropsies on 67 beached northern fulmars and found that 92.5 per cent had plastics -- such as twine, Styrofoam and candy wrappers -- in their stomach.",
